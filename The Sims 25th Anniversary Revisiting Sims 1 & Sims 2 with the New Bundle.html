      <h2>The Sims 25th Anniversary – Sims 1 + Sims 2 Bundle Review</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted May 7, 2025</p>
      <p><strong>The Sims</strong> turned 25 this February and to celebrate, EA has finally released a special <strong>Sims 1 + Sims 2</strong> bundle that fans have been dreaming of for years. Whether you’re a long-time Simmer or just curious about the franchise’s roots, this bundle offers a time capsule of gaming history. But how well do these classics hold up today? Let’s break it down with the pros and cons.</p>
  
      <h3>What’s in the Bundle?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Sims: Complete Collection</strong> – Base game + all 7 expansions</li>
        <li><strong>The Sims 2: Ultimate Collection</strong> – Base game + all 8 expansions + 10 stuff packs</li>
        <li><strong>Bonus content</strong> – Soundtracks, concept art, wallpapers, and optimized installers</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Two iconic classics:</strong> You get the full experience of Sims 1 and Sims 2 in one package, including every expansion.</li>
        <li><strong>Nostalgia preserved:</strong> Classic graphics, music, and gameplay charm that fans grew up with.</li>
        <li><strong>Playable on modern PCs:</strong> Finally updated for Windows 10/11—no workarounds needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Great value:</strong> Tons of content for the price, legally and DRM-free on supported platforms.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clunky controls:</strong> Especially in Sims 1, the UI and navigation feel dated by modern standards.</li>
        <li><strong>No guidance:</strong> These games don’t hold your hand. Expect trial and error.</li>
        <li><strong>Occasional bugs:</strong> While improved, Sims 2 can still have compatibility hiccups or crashes without mods.</li>
        <li><strong>No Mac support:</strong> The bundle is Windows-only for now.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Final Verdict</h3>
      <p>If you grew up with <em>The Sims</em> or want to experience the magic of its earliest days, this bundle is a fantastic piece of gaming history. While not perfect, it still offers some of the richest simulation gameplay out there.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Final Score: 8.5/10 – A must-play for fans and a great retro experience for newcomers.</strong></p>
